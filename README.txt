The Salamander Drumkit

As with the salamander grand piano, this has only been properly tested on linuxsampler but it should work with other sample
players that can load .sfz, it probably works better as it's not even half the size of the salamander piano
It doesn't have many velocity layers, but instead many samples per velocity, in an attempt to get a more authentic sound when programming.
The closed-hat has no less than 20 samples per velocity... only two velocity layers tho, so that makes 40 in total..
I've actually built the drumkit myself(in 2009) It's built out of birch staves and
has _very_ thick shells(couldn't lathe the insides) It also features an unusual one of a kind ropetuning system,
the 12" tomtom is a prototype of another kind tho tuning system..
